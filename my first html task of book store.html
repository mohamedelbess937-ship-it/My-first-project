               <b>* Purpose of the Book:</b> To offer practical advice to rulers on how to maintain and manage power effectively, even if it requires cunning or harsh decisions.<br>
                <b>* Key Ideas:</b><br>
                - Machiavelli argues that the ends justify the means — a ruler may need to make unethical choices if they serve the state's interest.<br>
                - He distinguishes between types of rule: hereditary, republican, and acquired, and explains how each can be preserved.<br>
                - He emphasizes the importance of strength and cleverness in politics, suggesting that a successful ruler must be both "a lion and a fox."<br>
                <b>* Style:</b> Direct, pragmatic, and free from philosophical abstraction, making it closely aligned with political reality.
